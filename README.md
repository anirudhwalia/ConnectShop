# Connect Shop

This project is part of TwilioHackathon with Dev.

This project is a online platform where user can search for nearby shops and look when it is open, allows this application allows user to see approv crowd density nearby.

### Problem 
During lockdowns and curfew most of the businesses are only opened for a very short period of time and it is tough for a person to check availability again and again, so our contribution is to build such application which allows users to connect with businesses without contacting them again and again even this apps sends push notifications according whenever the business is open.
This will reduce end user trips to businesses.
